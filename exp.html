          <h2 style="color:rgb(220, 60, 7);  font-size:40px;">building series circuit</h2>
          <p style="color:rgb(15, 14, 14); font-size:25px;">To build a series circuit, you will need a battery, a switch, and several light bulbs. Connect the positive end of the battery to one side of the switch, and then connect the other side of the switch to the first light bulb. From there, connect the second light bulb to the first one, and continue until all the light bulbs are connected in a series. Finally, connect the negative end of the battery to the last light bulb. When the switch is closed, the bulbs should light up in sequence.</p>
          <h2 style="color:rgb(220, 60, 7);  font-size:40px;">building parallel circuit</h2>
          <p style="color:rgb(12, 12, 12); font-size:25px;">To build a parallel circuit, you will need a battery, a switch, and several light bulbs. Connect the positive end of the battery to one side of the switch, and then connect each light bulb to the other side of the switch. This will create several separate branches in the circuit, with each bulb having its own path to the negative end of the battery. When the switch is closed, all the bulbs should light up at the same time..</p>
