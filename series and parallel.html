    <h2>series connection</h2>
    <p>A series circuit is a type of electrical circuit where the electrical components, like switches, lights, and batteries, are connected one after the other, like a train with cars. Electricity flows through each component in turn, but if one component doesn't work, the whole circuit stops working.

        For example, imagine a train that stops at every station along a track. Each station is like a light bulb or a switch in a series circuit. As the train passes through each station, electricity flows through that station's electrical system, and then on to the next station. But if there's a problem with the electrical system at any one station, the train can't continue its journey.
        
       
     Series circuits are used in lots of different things like toys, flashlights, and even computers. But they can be less efficient than other types of circuits, which means that they might not work as well if one part of the circuit isn't working properly.</p>

     <h2>parallel connection</h2>
     <p>A parallel connection is when things are connected side by side, like two rivers flowing next to each other. Imagine a river that splits into two, and instead of flowing into each other, they both keep flowing separately. This is like a parallel connection.

        In the same way, electrical components like batteries, switches and lights can be connected in parallel. Electricity flows through each component at the same time, just like the two rivers flow side by side. If there's a problem with one component, like a broken light bulb, the other components can still work because they're not affected by the problem. Parallel connections are used in lots of things like homes, cars and even amusement parks.</p>
